# Full Stack E-commerce - Setup & Run Guide

## 🎉 ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

All major issues in the Full Stack E-commerce project have been successfully resolved. Here's what was fixed:

### ✅ Issues Fixed:

1. **Environment Configuration** - Added `.env` files for backend and frontend
2. **Stripe Integration** - Complete payment system implementation (with graceful fallback)
3. **Cart Functionality Bug** - Fixed quantity increase/decrease logic
4. **Missing Dependencies** - Added Stripe SDK and proper configurations
5. **Backend API Endpoints** - Added payment processing endpoints
6. **Error Handling** - Enhanced validation and error management
7. **Frontend Integration** - Connected Stripe Elements with cart system
8. **Startup Issues** - Fixed React import issues and dependency installation

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Stripe Account (optional - for payment processing)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

#### Backend Configuration (.env)
The backend `.env` file has been created with the following template:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_here_change_in_production
PORT=4000
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51234567890abcdef_your_stripe_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Frontend Configuration (.env)
The frontend `.env` file has been created with:
```env
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51234567890abcdef_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=development
```

**🔑 IMPORTANT:** 
- The application will work WITHOUT Stripe keys for basic e-commerce functionality
- To enable payment processing, replace the placeholder Stripe keys with your actual test keys from your Stripe dashboard
- If Stripe keys are not configured, payment endpoints will return appropriate error messages

### Step 2: Database Setup

1. **Install MongoDB** (if not already installed)
2. **Start MongoDB** service
3. The application will automatically create the required collections

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Dependencies have been automatically installed. If you need to reinstall:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend  
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Admin (optional)
cd ../admin
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

#### Start Backend Server:
```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```
✅ Server will start on http://localhost:4000
✅ You'll see: "Server Running on port 4000" and "MongoDB connected successfully"
⚠️ If Stripe is not configured, you'll see a warning (this is normal)

#### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
✅ Frontend will start on http://localhost:3000
✅ Browser should automatically open the application

#### Start Admin Panel (optional):
```bash
cd admin
npm start
```
✅ Admin will start on http://localhost:3001
